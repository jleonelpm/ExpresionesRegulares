The complete list of Nirvana songs, by Rasmus Holmen for www.nirvanaclub.com
Updated: March 2005 by Brian Peterson --> http://members.aol.com/WPeter4105/
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following list includes pretty much everything Nirvana ever did in their
too short career; studio songs, live performances, covers, instrumentals, demos, 
jams, intros, rehearsals, destructions and more. Some of these 'songs' are just 
names after something the band has said on stage. For example when Grohl said 
"We practiced last night" - then it could end up as a song called "Practice" on 
some CD's. Note: The song is written by its most 'popular' title, hence the name
after the / is what the song has been called on bootlegs and on other sources.

The aim of this guide is to list every Nirvana song and a healthy selection of
the mislabeled names a bunch of the songs are given on various bootlegs. That way 
if you find a song title you don't recognize on a bootleg, you can look for 
it here, and hopefully find the correct song title. I hope you enjoy this guide!

The following list will, in most cases, not list tiny few-second jams the band made
during a live show - even if they were jamming on a song by a popular artist.

Some of the songs listed below have not been released officially. In that case,
the song might be available on a bootleg, but it is not guaranteed. In fact, some
of these songs have not surfaced on any recordings. Even if they have, it is not
possible to list exactly where to find these songs - and that is by no means the
purpose of this guide. The main purpose is to simply list Nirvana's songs and not
provide specific details about them (including which bootlegs they might appear on).

If you have a song title that you didn't find on this list, make sure to use the
"Find" or "Search" feature of your browser/editor, and search for the title first.

If you found a "rare" Nirvana song on the net, go to the NFC FAQ for more info and
to verify whether this track is on our list of fakes (it will more than likely be!)
Not all the fakes (mostly from file-sharing) are listed here. Look in the NFC FAQ.

Again: The main purpose of this guide is to merely list the titles of all Nirvana's
songs, and the false titles they have been given by bootleggers and other traders.
It is not a guide for detailed information about the rare songs. The rarities are
only described very briefly in this guide, some in more detail. Guides with more
details on some of these songs should be available on other Nirvana web sites.

Note #1:
Bad Moon Rising: a cover of Creedence Clearwater Revival, 
performed at early 1987 and 1988 shows. It appears on a set list 
in 'Come As You Are'. Performed under the band name "The Sellouts".
Unfortunately a recording of Nirvana doing this song is unsurfaced.
Though, apparently the song was jammed at 11/9/89 after 'Swap Meet'

Note #2:
Fountain Soda: before "Muddy Banks" was released, there was rumor 
that a new Nirvana double-CD set was going to come out under the title 
"Cookie", and this was to be a song on it. From Brian; "It had been heard 
that one song from Hole's unplugged show was one of three (I might be off 
on the number) Kurt wrote/recorded in the last days before his death. The
rumor that this song was also done by Nirvana was based solely on conjecture 
as to which Hole song it was."

Note #3:
Run, Rabbit, Run: This song was played at 12/21/88 Hoquiam, WA and should
indeed be the Smack cover. It was most likely only performed live this one time.

Note #4:
Raunchola: This song was played at the 01/23/88 Tacoma, WA show. Also called 
'Run, Rabbit, Run' by bootleggers. Run, Rabbit, Run - a Smack Cover - was really 
performed at 12/21/88 and is not this song; the song that was performed during 
the end of 01/23/88 is called Raunchola on the box set. The song is followed by a 
cover of the Led Zeppelin classic "Moby Dick," finishing off the show, which also 
appears on the box set.

Note #5:
I Wanna Be Your Dog: Nirvana covered this song by the Stooges. Tyler and Eric noted 
that 'Confusion Is Sex' has nothing to do with "I Wanna Be Your Dog", however this
Sonic Youth CD does contain a cover of that Stooges song in the end of 'Freezer Burn'.

Note #6:
In His Hands/Verse Chorus Verse: After months of debates and arguments, it should have
been established that this song - performed at the 4/17/91, 11/25/90 and 8/17/90 shows -
is in fact called "Verse Chorus Verse". This title is printed on an authentic set list for
4/17/91 and the title was confirmed by Krist to be the one of this song. This song 
is usually mislabeled as "In His Hands" or "In His Room" on commercial bootlegs.

Note #7:
Sappy: This song is available on the "No Alternative" compilation and was recorded a 
couple of times in the studio. It was also performed live many times. Some believe it
changed name to "Verse Chorus Verse" at some point, but this is unlikely considering
that the song - mentioned above - already uses this title. The song has been given
a host of different names as you can see in the list above. However, Krist Novoselic
confirmed that "Sappy" was the correct name of the song from the "No Alternative" CD. 
The 2004 boxset also confirms the real name of this song as "Sappy."
